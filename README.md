What is the difference between Phoenix, Phoenix Lite, and Arsenic?
Phoenix is a feature-rich nuking tool that offers a wide range of capabilities. However, it may be slow. Phoenix Lite is fast but supports only bot tokens and has limited features. It is designed to quickly execute specific actions for server nuking purposes. Arsenic offers flexible token checking but has limited nuking capabilities.
